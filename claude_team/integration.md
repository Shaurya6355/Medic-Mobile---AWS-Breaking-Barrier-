# integration.md - Shared System State and Work Log

Every team member's Claude reads this file at session start and updates it at session end. It keeps all laptops working from the same picture. Master rules are in [claude.md](claude.md).

Rules for this file:

- Pull before you read. After you update, tell the human, who reviews and pushes. Claude never pushes.
- Section 1 (system state) is edited in place by the owner of that system.
- Section 3 (work log) is append-only, newest entry at the bottom. Never edit another person's entry.
- Write what a teammate needs to know to continue without asking you.
- No emoji, no secrets, no personal data.

## 1. System state

One row per system or component. The owner keeps their row current.

| System | Owner | Status | Interface or contract | Location (repo path or AWS resource) | Last updated |
|--------|-------|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| Guideline intake (S3, Textract or alternative) | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Logic drafting and cross-check (Bedrock) | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Validators (completeness, exclusivity, reachability, golden cases) | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Approval steps and review UI | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Deterministic compiler (XLSForm, tasks.js) | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Build-and-test container (cht-conf, test harness) | unassigned | not started | | | |
| CHT test instance and test data | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Infrastructure as code | unassigned | not started | | | |
| Audit records (S3, DynamoDB) | unassigned | not started | | | |

Status values: not started, in progress, working locally, integrated, blocked.

## 2. Team and environments

| Person | Laptop or environment | Systems they own | Notes |
|--------|-----------------------|------------------|-------|

Shared environment settings every laptop must match:
